## Work Experience

### Makers Academy (Mar 2022 to Jul 2022)<br>
**16-week intensive coding bootcamp**

- Used TDD to test drive production quality code for pair tasks throughout the week, individual challenges each weekend and for bigger [projects](#projects) towards the end of the course. 
- Everything we did during the week was in a pair programming setting. We would complete our tasks often using the pomodoro technique to schedule breaks which I found would easily increase our efficiency, resillience to work through blockers, enjoyment and our code quality.
- For these projects, we followed Agile methodologies including morning standups, wrote and estimated ticket times using trello boards, made a goals and planning Miro board and set out our values and expectations from one another before starting any work. This made it feel like we were working in a live tech department.
- Undertook numerous external reviews to mimick job interview tech tests. These allowed me to gain critical feedback on my coding process in order to grow in both confidence and ability each week.

### 5aside.org -_Sports Operations_ (May 2020 to Mar 2022)<br>
- Responsible for the day to day operations of over 40 5-a-side football leagues in london.
