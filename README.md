Since leaving the sports analysis world in 2019, I have been searching for a more meaningful career that allows me to use my naturally analytical brain to find a job that I enjoy, can have a healthy work-life balance and can problem-solve on a daily basis. In March 2022 I made the choice to stop working what I always described as "gap-filler" jobs, and took the plunge to apply to Makers Academy software engineering bootcamp to start a new beginning.

I first started the code academy Ruby course in January 2022 and managed to log my first 'Hello, World!' not long after. Since then I have been improving every single day that I code, and am now capable of TDD'ing full stack MERN applications. What a ride these past few months have been.

## Education
### Makers Academy (Mar 2022 to Jul 2022)<br>
**16-week intensive coding bootcamp**

- Used TDD to test drive production quality code for pair tasks throughout the week, individual challenges each weekend and for bigger [projects](#projects) towards the end of the course. 
- Everything we did during the week was in a pair programming setting. We would complete our tasks often using the pomodoro technique to schedule breaks which I found would easily increase our efficiency, resilience to work through blockers, enjoyment and our code quality.
- For these projects, we followed Agile methodologies including morning standups, wrote and estimated ticket times using trello boards, made a goals and planning Miro board and set out our values and expectations from one another before starting any work. This made it feel like we were working in a live tech department.
- Undertook numerous external reviews to mimic job interview tech tests. These allowed me to gain critical feedback on my coding process in order to grow in both confidence and ability each week.

### Cardiff Metropolitan University (2015-2017)<br>
**Sports Performance Analysis, Upper Second-Class Honours**
- External placement: Head of Rugby Analysis: Cardiff University RFC
- External Placement: Performance Analyst: Celtic Dragons Netball Club
- Internal Placement: Performance Analyst: Cardiff Metropolitan University Netball Club

## Key Skills

#### Prolific Learner
All throughout the Makers course, we have learnt new technologies, frameworks and engineering concepts. It was a daunting prospect to start learning JavaScript after only 6 weeks of using ruby on the course, however it was a challenge that I overcame by just getting hands-on with the new technology. I learn best by trying things and growing through a process of trial and error. Reading materials, following tutorials and working with others to understand why we were using the new tech, rather than just learning it definitely cut the learning curve. A prime example of this is during our final project where we built a fully functional web app using React and Koa, two technologies that none of us had ever used in any capacity. By the end of the two weeks we had a fully interactive one page react web application run on node.js. Feel free to take a peek here [TimTom EV Routing](https://github.com/SamButton12/ev-routing). My personal progression can be seen throughout my github repositories, and showcase my ability to write production quality code and how it has progressed since the course began.<br>

#### Collaborative
In every role I have worked in, I have been part of a wider team working words a common goal. During my time as a performance analyst, I was responsible for collecting multiple streams of data on players, work with coaches, players, physio and S&C coaches to understand the players goals/targets were, and then build out multiple reports from the data that I had collected. Keeping track of which stakeholders wanted which outputs and pieces of data was a common theme and over time I build up a great working relationship with all of them, to the point at which I could go above and beyond to offer them insights that they weren't even aware of previously.<br>

#### Performance Under Pressure
During my time at London Irish RFC, I would work to collect data on players during a match and then work to deliver the reports to the coaches as early as possible. This often meant working well into the nights as games were late afternoon. This time-critical delivery schedule taught me to deliver not just quickly, but to a high quality as any mistakes were easily picked out and would impact the coaches. I found this experience of working against the clock particularly useful during one of the projects at makers. We were producing a facebook clone and had a list of features that we were trying to implement before the end of the week. I was able to combine my judgement of timeframes on tickets alongside the ability to produce high quality code quickly to complete a feature that allowed users to post pictures as posts. <br>

#### Problem Solver
I'm drawn to disciplines which require problem solving. I love the thought process, the iterations, the creativity, the research and ultimately the satisfaction of solving a problem. I generally attribute my problem solving prowess to my ability to mentally visualise scenarios, whether it's a physical structure or a collection of theoretical objects and processes.<br>
At Makers, I've learnt to formalise my problem solving by using TDD to write my code. The process of writing a test before solving the problem allows you to clarify in your mind exactly what the problem is before solving it. Once you have the test written, you can easily know if you were successful in solving your problem.
